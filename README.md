# Challenge 3

This is a follow up to challenge 2. Instead of making an API call when a user clicks the submit button, I used a custom endpoint created using ExpressJS to do that.
When the endpoint receives an id, it calls the API and returns to the frontend a list of album photos with only title and thumbnail URL.
